# REST API

Building RESTful web services, like other programming skills is part art, part science. 
As the Internet industry progresses, creating a REST API becomes more concrete with emerging best practices. 
As RESTful web services don't follow a prescribed standard except for HTTP, 
it's important to build your RESTful API in accordance with industry best practices to ease development and increase client adoption.

## Node.js

As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications. 
In the following "hello world" example, many connections can be handled concurrently. 
Upon each connection, the callback is fired, but if there is no work to be done, Node.js will sleep.

## Express

**Web Applications**

Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

**APIs**

With a myriad of HTTP utility methods and middleware at your disposal, creating a robust API is quick and easy.

**Performance**

Express provides a thin layer of fundamental web application features, without obscuring Node.js features that you know and love.

```
$ npm install express --save

```

## Postgre SQL

PostgreSQL comes with many features aimed to help developers build applications, administrators to protect data integrity and build fault-tolerant environments, and help you manage your data no matter how big or small the dataset. In addition to being free and open source, PostgreSQL is highly extensible. For example, you can define your own data types, build out custom functions, even write code from different programming languages without recompiling your database!

## Sequelize
Sequelize is a promise-based Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server. It features solid transaction support, relations, eager and lazy loading, read replication and more.

Sequelize is available via npm (or yarn).
```
npm install --save sequelize
```
You'll also have to manually install the driver for your database of choice:

#### One of the following:
```
$ npm install --save pg pg-hstore # Postgres
$ npm install --save mysql2
$ npm install --save mariadb
$ npm install --save sqlite3
$ npm install --save tedious # Microsoft SQL Server
```

## TypeScript
TypeScript is an open-source language which builds on JavaScript, one of the worldâ€™s most used tools, by adding static type definitions.

Types provide a way to describe the shape of an object, providing better documentation, and allowing TypeScript to validate that your code is working correctly.

Writing types can be optional in TypeScript, because type inference allows you to get a lot of power without writing additional code.

```
$ npm install typescript --save-dev
```
